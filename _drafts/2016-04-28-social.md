* _Get comfortable_: mentally and physically
* _Watch for the marketing angle_: Blah blah blah.
* _Bridge analogy_: Blah blah blah.
* _Just say words_: Blah blah blah.
* _Smalltalk isn't the point_: Blah blah blah. about neither person
* _It's not all about you_: Instead of saying something about you, ask a Q
* _But don't interrogate_: If one person is just asking questions and the
  other is just talking it's bad
* _Contradict gracefully_: Blah blah blah.
