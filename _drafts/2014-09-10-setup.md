In this post I'll give a [usesthis.com](http://usesthis.com/)-style description
of my home office hardware and software setup.

## Hardware

![My desk](/public/desksmall.jpg)

There isn't any need to move myself to different locations to do work, so I
don't have a laptop, but I value small size and low noise in computers so
I use an [Intel NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/overview.html).
NUCs come with no storage device so there's no OS (fee).
The chunkiest thing I have on my desk is a 2560x1440 27" monitor and that seems
to be enough pixels for me. 
After I got my Kinesis Advantage keyboard I could never go back to a non-split
keyboard style.
I don't use a mouse, so I can put a pad of paper conveniently right next to my
keyboard.
In the image above, you can see some printed vim cheatsheets taped to my
monitor.

## Software

The first things to note about software are that I use Linux, specifically, the
latest Ubuntu LTS version, and that I tend to go for keyboard-accessible
applications.
Why do I keep a rodent-free workspace and use only a keyboard, you ask?
First of all, I do sometimes need a mouse, and when I do I try to use my left
hand, solving the desk space issue.
Ergonomics and productivity are the main other reasons.
Frequently moving my hand from keyboard to mouse (or just away from the home
row) and back breaks the flow of my actions.
Also, there's something more "discrete" about pressing keys than moving a mouse
which makes interactions simpler, more precise, and easier to automate.
Keyboard-accessible software means a lot of keybindings, and for me those are
vim-style keybindings whenever possible.

In Ubuntu, I'm always running xmonad, Firefox, and Konsole.
The (practically) only application I have that doesn't run in either a console
or browser window is Mathematica.
Console applications are always keyboard-friendly (except sometimes they use
the arrow or function keys, humph).
For everything else, I use web apps.
To make Firefox keyboard-friendly I use the Pentadactyl extension, disable all
plugins, and remove mouse-related chrome such as scrollbars and close-tab
buttons.
In console windows I usually run tmux.

For email I use mutt and Fastmail with POP3.
My shell is zsh with which I use [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd).
My editor is vim, my torrent program is rtorrent, and my RSS reader is
newsbeuter.
