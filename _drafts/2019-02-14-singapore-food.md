title: "Foodies in Singapore by district"
---

Food is a special part of Singapore's culture but how do dining experiences
vary within the city's many neighbourhoods?
Which district has the absolute best food in Singapore?
Where should you go to find the biggest selection of popular eats?

Data to the rescue! Restaurant-goers in Singapore love social media and this
means that by scouring thousands of posts by Singapore foodies we can get
a snapshot of where people are going to eat out.

Singapore is divided up into 55 official planning areas, each with its
distinctive local colours.
More than half of foodies' social media posts come from the central areas shown
here:

for a full map of the rest of the planning areas in the city.

So let's get to the results!
