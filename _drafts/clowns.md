title: I miss class clowns
---

In grade school, most of my classes had some students that I found really
funny.  
I'm pretty sure that I appreciated their in-class humor more than most
other students.

<blockquote><strong>Teacher</strong> (pointing to two options on the board):
What's the answer, this or this?

<strong>Student E</strong> (not pointing at anything): This.

<strong>Me</strong>: giggle</blockquote>

I also giggled...
when Student E chugged an entire can of Red Bull during a brief period when the
chemistry teacher was facing the board;
when Student D quietly spent most of one geography class reaching behind his
chair unscrewing all the screws in the desk behind him so that finally the top
of that student's desk suddenly fell off in a cloud of sawdust;
when Student T peed in a garbage can;
when Student M cut a hole in the crotch of his sweat pants with scissors;
when in music class, Student J held a normal drum stick and two bass drum
sticks and made jerking gestures at an angle that the teacher couldn't see but
the students could, leading to much laughter and a confused an annoyed teacher;
when there was a glue-stick fight in a classroom that the teacher had briefly
stepped out of;
when Student A needed to empty his pencil sharpener so he dumped it out in
someone's pencil case, and then emptied the three-hole punch in there too for
good measure;
when Student L flipped over a full garbage can so that the next responsible
person to see it would have the challenge of flipping it back up again but
making as small a mess as possible;
when, one physics class, Student E yelled the "<a

lyric from Crank That at random intervals;
when Student J2 stored a large quantity of novels from the class bookshelf in
his desk for no reason -- at one point the teacher discovered the stash and I
witnessed the utterly bizarre scene where the teacher kept fishing another and
another book out of the desk, looking completely astounded and furious;
when Student E went up to a female teacher and rubbed his face in her hair
(really testing her patience);
when Student L called the cell phone of and mooned a student who was at the
front of class giving a presentation;
when Student S took the teacher's instruction that our poems could be "any
length" literally and submitted a seven word poem;
when a group task to build a tower with straws and marshmallows turned into a
_stielhandgranate_-chucking fight;
when Student S made a saxaphone "recording" by using a MIDI editor and
submitted it as his playing test;
when a computer science major visited our programming class to answer
questions, Student E shouted out as the visitor entered the class, "you sex
machine!";
when Student A used VNC to make another student's MS Word appear "haunted";
when Student C intentionally made screeching noises during choir that the very
strict teacher couldn't trace to any individual;
when during drama class, we were in groups brainstorming for skits and the word
"dominatrix" was overheard from one group and the teacher immediately calmly
but sternly said in that group's direction "no";
when Student A didn't care to finish his sandwich at lunch time so he filed it
in a nearby filing cabinet under S and left it there;
when Student K changed the desktop background on all the computers in the lab
to an MS Paint drawing of Student B with a big dick and some text including the
word "bith" -- when a student booted a computer to show a project the teacher
saw it and said in a honest suggesting tone of voice, "well, change that" as if
the image was part of the project;
and many other times.

I sometimes fed the clowns ideas.  They'd use the idea for some stunt and get
the attention, but also take the risks, and we'd all get the laughs.  Plus, the
clowns had the skills to execute the ideas better than I could.

In university, class clowns vanished and attending school was less enjoyable.
Yes, that kind of humor is immature, but I don't seem to have grown out of it.
My mind is still efficient at generating toilet humor.
