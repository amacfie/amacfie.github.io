C. Napier on India:
"The Eastern intellect is great, and supported by amiable feelings, and the
Native officers have a full share of Eastern daring, genius and ambition; but
to nourish these qualities they must be placed on a par with European
officers."

Elgin on China:
"...the most cynical representations of the grotesque have been the principal
products of Chinese conceptions of the sublime and beautiful. Nevertheless I am
disposed to believe that under this mass of abortions and rubbish there lie
hidden some sparks of a diviner fire, which the genius of my countrymen may
gather and nurse into a flame."

it was attributed to Napoleon that he said, "China is a sleeping giant. Let her
sleep. For when she wakes, she will shake the world."

W. Campbell, after Japanese takeover of Taiwan:
"The influence of the so-called literati has now gone for ever from Formosa.
These are the gentry who swear by Confucius and all his opinions. They are held
in high esteem, the common people looking upon them as dungeons of learning, and
as very fortunate in being able to make potfuls of money at teaching and every
low kind of pettifogging. About seventy per cent of their learning is a mere
fraud, and consists in the power of memorizing the Chinese Classics, and in
keeping close to the traditional comments which have been made upon them."
