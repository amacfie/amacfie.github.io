C. Napier on India:
"The Eastern intellect is great, and supported by amiable feelings, and the
Native officers have a full share of Eastern daring, genius and ambition; but
to nourish these qualities they must be placed on a par with European
officers."

Elgin on China:
"...the most cynical representations of the grotesque have been the principal
products of Chinese conceptions of the sublime and beautiful. Nevertheless I am
disposed to believe that under this mass of abortions and rubbish there lie
hidden some sparks of a diviner fire, which the genius of my countrymen may
gather and nurse into a flame."

it was attributed to Napoleon that he said, "China is a sleeping giant. Let her
sleep. For when she wakes, she will shake the world."
