title: Artificial general intelligence strategies
---

It might seem like theoretical physics is the end of the line for reductionism,
but is it really where the simplest, most fundamental models of reality are
examined?
Maybe not: Why research physics when you can write a computer program to
research physics?
If that's possible, maybe the AI models used in the program are more basic than
the contents of theories in physics.

Obviously I'm biased against physics because it gets a lot of funding and
status and it's not my field.
Theoretical physics (and theoretical mathematics) are sometimes 'justified'
on the ground that they might not have applications (soon) but they're just
so cool.
Well, other things are theoretical and cool too.
In fact, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is theoretical, cool, and
is relatively likely to have impactful applications soon, too.

However, I have realized that AGI never will be my field either so I'm writing
this post to reflect on and wrap up the little bit of thinking I did on the
subject before I knew by career plans.


At first, to me the obvious way to build, say, an automated theorem proving
(ATP) system, which could power an AGI
[universal predictor](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_probability#AIXI_and_a_Universal_Definition_of_Intelligence)
module, was to just dump all the heuristics, tricks, and strategies I use when
solving mathematics problems into some kind of proof-search code.
This sounds like roughly the idea behind Lenat's Automated Mathematician,
although that was more of a conjecturer than a prover.
The program was reimplemented [here](https://github.com/akkartik/am-utexas/tree/master)
and there is active research in the area.

Other ideas included using some kind of machine learning to learn proof
strategies from databases of formal proofs entered by humans.
This idea has also been explored by others.

If I were to work in AGI, I might try to develop OpenCog, the most active practical
AGI project I'm aware of.
I find theoretical work in AIXI, the Goedel machine, Hutter Search, and the
Optimal Ordered Problem Solver interesting, too.
Even Timothy Gowers got involved in the world of automated reasoning with
[a program that generates proofs in readable English](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4501).

Then again maybe brain uploads are the way to go anyway.
Robin Hanson
[thinks so](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/shared-ai-wins.html):
"The idea that you could create human level
intelligence by just feeding raw data into the right math-inspired architecture
is pure fantasy."
