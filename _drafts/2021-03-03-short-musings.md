When I was 17 my lowest grade was in math and I thought I wasn't good at it.
One year later I was obsessed with it.
Things can change.

Robin Hanson overstates how relatively less practical research is seen as more
prestigious in academia.
Tyler Cowen is right and Eric Weinstein is wrong:
academia generally embraces good ideas.

Computer algebra is useful but discovering new algorithms is hard.

As Robin Hanson and Steve Levitt say, life is long. There's lots of time to
do lots of different things.
