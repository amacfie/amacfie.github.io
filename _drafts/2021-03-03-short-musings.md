When I was 17 my lowest grade was in math and I thought I wasn't good at it.
One year later I was obsessed with it.
Things can change.

Robin Hanson says that academia views impractical research as more prestigious.
Yes, pure mathematics and theoretical physics are impractical and prestigious
but ceteris paribus a research finding plus an application is more prestigious
than just a research finding.

There's a meta-contrarian idea that the mechanisms of academia exclude some
really good science that's just too unconventional. This is not true to the
extent claimed.
<!-- Tyler Cowen said something like this somewhere. -->

Computer algebra is useful but discovering new algorithms to automate
mathematical work is hard.

As Robin Hanson and Steve Levitt say, life is long. There's lots of time to
do lots of different things.

rationality is an important scientific concept in AI, finance, and statistics;
I don't think the self-help aspect was ever central.

Beauty is subjective and calling your product "beautiful" is pretentious.

Juergen Schmidhuber is right and Tyler Cowen is wrong: China will surpass
the US in dominance this century.
