title: My childhood experience with IT
---

Until age 10, I used two different types of computers.
The first was the
family computer which ran Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on a 33 MHz processor and
had no network connection. 
The second was the school Macintoshes and, later,
iMacs. 
During this period I remember arguing with a friend that the Altavista
search engine was better than Google -- an opinion based on a single lucky
search on Altavista that turned up very useful information for a Middle Ages
project. 
My favorite software back then was probably Microsoft Excel, Word,
and PowerPoint. 
I remember being surprised when an adult suggested using the
same PowerPoint theme for every slide in the presentation, rather than a
different one for each; apparently a good design sense isn't innate.

When I was 11, my family bought a computer with Windows XP and a high-speed
internet connection. 
This marked the beginning of my obsession with IT. 
The
family bought another Windows XP computer later, and at age 16 I was given my
own laptop. 
From age 11 to about age 15, I was mainly interested in playing PC
games, chatting, and listening to music on the computer, but eventually my
interests shifted.

I went to a programming summer camp around age 14 and learned some DarkBASIC.
However, it wasn't age 15 when I picked up *Visual Basic for the Absolute
Beginner* (which my grandfather had bought in hopes that it would help him
learn how to use his first computer) that I really got serious about
programming. 
After that book, I continued to Francesco Balena's *Programming
Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Version 2003*. 
By the end of high school, I had
spent time learning JavaScript, Perl, C++, Java, Ruby, Bash, F#, MATLAB,
Python, and Assembly.

I had an obsession with IT security which lasted from age 15 to age 17. 
During those two years I alternated between reading programming books and
reading books on some topic related to security. 
I developed a fairly complete firewall application for Windows at age 15-16 but
I didn't bother doing hooks properly so it was too slow to use. 
With a friend, I almost started a company, offering security software and 
penetration testing.
Slightly after I lost most of my interest in security, I attended a SecTor
conference and met H. D. Moore. 
These days I don't care very much about security, but it is useful to have
learned how the web works.

There was a brief period in the summer at age 16 or 17 when I became interested
in web design. 
I think the high point was watching the documentary
*Helvetica*. 
I still occasionally use the Photoshop skills I picked up, but I should be
outsourcing as much design work as I can.
