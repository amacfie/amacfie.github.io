>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible
>terms, there are three really fundamental observations:
>(i) Space-time is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $$M$$, endowed with a metric
>tensor and goverened by geometrical laws.
>(ii) Over $$M$$ is a vector bundle $$X$$ with a nonabelian gauge group $$G$$.
>(iii) Fermions are sections of
>$$(\tilde{S}_{+} \otimes V_R) \oplus (\tilde{S}_{-} \otimes V_{\tilde{R}})$$.
>$$R$$ and $$\tilde{R}$$ are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic
>explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a
>representation difference $$\Delta$$ in some underlying theory.
>All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical
>laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be
>interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.
