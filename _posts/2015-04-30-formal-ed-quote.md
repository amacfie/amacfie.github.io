To put it mildly, I'm not a fan of school (not including grad school).
Rather than launch into a rant on the subject, which might be therapeutic if
not pleasant, I'll let others do it for me; suffice it to say I wish I had gone
the autodidact route.

"I have never let my schooling interfere with my education"
-Mark Twain

"One could get a first-class education from a shelf of books five feet long"
-Charles Eliot

"The human-capital view argues that education actually confers 'added value'
on students ...
A problem with this view is that there are much more efficient ways to learn
career-relevant skills and facts: through reading books, watching documentaries,
talking with experts, and finding mentors."
-Geoffrey Miller

"School isn't about Learning"
-Robin Hanson

"all the really good programmers are self-taught"
-Brian Bi

"There is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in
Books"
-David Hume

"I can think of ... school-inculcated bad habits of thought, too many to list"
-Eliezer Yudkowsky

"School can better be seen as a vaccination program against knowledge than a
process for instilling knowledge in people"
-Michael Vassar

"How I hated schools, and what a life of anxiety I lived there.
I counted the
hours to the end of every term, when I should return home."
-Winston Churchill

"Shut up! Shut up and leave me alone with my books!"
-Zack M. Davis

"Real education must ultimately be limited to one who INSISTS on knowing, the
rest is mere sheep-herding."
-Ezra Pound

Etc., etc.
