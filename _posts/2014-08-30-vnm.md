The death of von Neumann (1903-1957), as excerpted from [Prisoner's Dilemma by
Poundstone](http://www.amzn.com/B004KPM1GM):

>In April 1956 von Neumann checked into Walter Reed Hospital for
>what was to be a permanent stay. 

>"On one dramatic occasion near the end, there
>was a meeting at Walter Reed Hospital where, gathered around his bedside and
>attentive to his last words of advice and wisdom, were the Secretary of Defense
>and his Deputies, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and all the
>military Chiefs of Staff. 
>The central figure was the young mathematician who but a few years before had
>come to the United States as an immigrant from Hungary. 
>I have never witnessed a more dramatic scene or a more moving tribute
>to a great intelligence."

>Von Neumann suffered profound depression. 
>At times he could discourse on mathematics or history, or remember
>conversations word for word from years ago; other times he would not even
>recognize family or friends.
>Wrote Heims, "Then came complete psychological breakdown; panic; screams of
>uncontrollable terror every night." 
>In a short film made of von Neumann's life, Teller says, "I think that von
>Neumann suffered more when his mind would no longer function than I have ever
>seen any human being suffer."

>The last von Neumann memory anecdote tells of his brother Michael reading him
>Goethe's *Faust* in the original German in the hospital. 
>As Michael would pause to turn the page, von Neumann would rattle off the next
>new lines from memory.
