This is an update to [this post](http://amacfie.github.io/2014/09/10/setup/).

A notepad beside the keyboard isn't good enough because the writing surface
is still too out of the way.
Instead, I now push the keyboard towards the monitor and have one piece of paper
directly in front of me on the desk, on which I can wrest my arms when using
the keyboard.
I also now use a convertible laptop instead of a desktop computer so the screen
is closer and at a more similar angle to the paper.
