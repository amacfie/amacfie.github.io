What exactly is beautiful math?

My hypothesis is that generally when people talk about beauty in mathematics
they're talking about things that teach us something useful for proving new
facts.
For example, proving a difficult but simple theorem is useful because its
difficulty means it may imply other previously difficult theorems, and its
simplicity means it may show up and be used often.
A theorem that establishes a connection between two previously disparate areas
of mathematics is considered beautiful, and
such a connection allows knowledge from one are to be applied to the other,
potentially cracking new problems.
An unexpected proof -- "an unexpected perspective" or "surprising twist" --
offers something new to be learned, something that can then be used for other
problems.
