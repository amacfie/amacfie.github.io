What's a simple but useful characterization of beauty in mathematics?
I claim a proof is beautiful if it teaches us something useful for proving new
facts.
For example, proving a difficult but simple theorem is useful because its
difficulty means it may imply other previously difficult theorems, and its
simplicity means it may show up and be used often.
A theorem that establishes a connection between two previously disparate areas
of mathematics is considered beautiful;
such a connection allows knowledge from one are to be applied to the other,
potentially cracking new problems.
An unexpected proof -- "an unexpected perspective" or "surprising twist" --
offers something new to be learned, something that can then be used for other
problems.
Whimsically we could even say an efficient automated theorem prover must
contain a good deal of beauty.
