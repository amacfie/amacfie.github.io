* Be challenged. Seek material at the level and pace appropriate for you.
  Learn with people who aren't all dumber than you.
* If you're motivated to learn/build something, do it. If you're not motivated,
  don't force yourself.
* Don't be afraid of the unknown. Just because a topic is advanced or
  is in an unfamiliar field doesn't mean it's difficult to learn; go for it.
* Don't do undergrad if you don't need to. Subjects like math, computer
  science, and economics can be learned conveniently and effectively
  using books, videos, and other resources from the internet. For some
  people, autodidacticism is very efficient.
  If you do have to take classes, ideally learn the material beforehand
  (paradoxical as that sounds).
  Getting a programming job doesn't require a degree. If you need an
  academic credential, write a paper with a professor and get it published.
  Professors will be glad to work with young people they don't have to pay,
  and the mentorship will be valuable for you.
  This strategy could get you into a grad school if you're interested,
  depending on the circumstances.
  On the other hand, undergrad is useful for the social network, which is much
  more valuable the more prestigious the school is.
* Some things can't be learned from textbooks because the textbooks don't
  exist, e.g. decision theory.
* Some concepts take a while to really absorb, possibly years. In the words
  of John von Neumann,
  "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to
  them."
* Don't go to a bad grad school. At the graduate level, low-status schools
  have poor funding, low research activity, and few students.
* Get a supervisor who is unambiguously an expert in the field.
* The world doesn't need more junk research, focus on quality rather than
  quantity.
* Sometimes in research it's more productive to explore without a particular
  target. Open problems can be daunting. Start with something tractable,
  even if it's pretty random. Once you've made progress, you might see how
  your approach can be extended.
* Attend economics seminars because they're a blast.
