* Be challenged. Seek material at the level and pace appropriate for you.
  Learn with people who aren't all dumber than you.
* If you're motivated to learn or build something, do it. If you're not
  motivated, don't force yourself.
* Don't be afraid of the unknown. Just because a topic is advanced or
  is in an unfamiliar field doesn't mean it's difficult to learn; go for it.
* Some things can't be learned from textbooks because the textbooks don't
  exist, e.g. decision theory.
* Some concepts take a while to really absorb, possibly years. In the words
  of John von Neumann,
  "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to
  them."
* There's nothing wrong with funding your studies by borrowing against future
  earnings as long as you're not overpaying for your education. Internships
  are great too.
* Don't do undergrad if you don't need to. Subjects like mathematics, computer
  science, and economics can be learned conveniently and effectively
  using books, videos, and other resources from the internet.
  If you need an academic credential, write a paper with a professor in your
  city and get it published.
  The mentorship will be valuable and with just publications and reference
  letters applying to grad school is an option (see e.g.
  [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Voevodsky&oldid=1078337374#Early_life_and_education)).
* If you formally take a course, ideally learn the material by yourself
  beforehand (paradoxical as that sounds).
* Don't go to a bad grad school. At the graduate level, low-status schools
  have poor funding, low research activity, and few students.
* Get a thesis supervisor who is unambiguously an expert in the field.
* Attend economics seminars because they're a blast.

<!--
* The world doesn't need more junk research, focus on quality rather than
  quantity.
* Sometimes in research it's more productive to explore without a particular
  target. Open problems can be daunting. Start with something tractable,
  even if it's pretty random. Once you've made progress, you might see how
  your approach can be extended.
