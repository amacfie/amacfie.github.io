>Why not experiment with wholesome personal relationships? Some recreational
>socialising?
>Maybe.
>I dabble.
>I'm a social primate susceptible to peer
>pressure.
>No man is an island, etc, even those with a metaphysic evocative of
>windowless [monads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology).
>[I fret that the *only* thing one can ever know is the
>intrinsic subjective properties of whichever configuration of matter and energy
>one happens to instantiate. *cf*. [Lockwood](http://www.hedweb.com/lockwood.htm).]
>Sadly, my conspecifics are a dangerous, expensive and tainted source of opioid
>supply with endogenous habits of their own to feed.
>Moreover my inferential realism about so-called
>[perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_perception) is a deterrent to intimacy: personal relationships become a branch
>of speculative metaphysics if each virtual world resembles a solipsistic
>island-universe.
>Indeed I worry that the closest I come to staying in touch
>with the real world is eating bits of it: the epistemology of
>[food](http://www.moodfoods.com/), so to
>speak.
>And germs.
>If I meet my end under the wheels of the proverbial London bus, my faith in the
>mind-independent world will be posthumously vindicated.
>As
>it happens, I have just finished reading Simon Critchley's *The Book of Dead*
>*Philosophers* (2008); perhaps my best hope of immortality lies, not churning out
>philosophical verbiage, but having the equivalent of a tortoise fall on my
>head.
>This untimely fate exhausts my knowledge of Aeschylus.
