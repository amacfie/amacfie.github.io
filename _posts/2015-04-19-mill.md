I believe "school logic" is a.k.a. [scholastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism)
logic and is something along the lines of "philosophical" logic and what Mill
covered in his _A System of Logic_.
Sometimes I found combinatorics problems to require careful thinking in order
to avoid plausible-looking mistakes.
At [Art of Problem Solving](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Combinatorics/Olympiad),
instructors suggest "counting in two ways", i.e. using two different counting
strategies and comparing the results.
