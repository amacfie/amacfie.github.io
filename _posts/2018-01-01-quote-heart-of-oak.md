>Come cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,<br />
>To add something new to this wonderful year;<br />
>To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,<br />
>For who are so of free as we sons of the waves?<br />
>
>Heart of Oak are our ships,<br />
>Jolly Tars are our men,<br />
>We always are ready: Steady, boys, Steady!<br />
>We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.
