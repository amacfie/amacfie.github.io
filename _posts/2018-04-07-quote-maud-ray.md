title: "Quote of the day: Maud Ray Kent"
---

Paraphrasing from Macrae's biography of J. von Neumann:

>In 1940 the Germans captured Denmark plus Niels Bohr. A cable arrived
>in Britain from Otto Frisch's aunt in Sweden saying, "Met Niels and [wife]
>Margarethe recently. Both well but unhappy about events. Please inform Cockroft
>[British nuclear scientist] and Maud Ray Kent".
>
>Who or what was "Maud Ray Kent"? The British decided it was an anagram for
>"radyum taken" and thus gave warning that the Germans were moving fast to
>develop an A-bomb. Perhaps that was the reason the Nazis had occupied Bohr's
>Copenhagen, and were capturing Norway and its heavy water too? Someone
>suggested that Maud might actually stand for "Military Application: Uranium
>Disintegration". The British nuclear program commenced under the name "MAUD
>Committee", as a tribute to the brilliant anagram.
>
>Down in her home in Kent, Miss Maud Ray, the English governess to Bohr's
>children, remained uncontacted because nobody had heard of her.
