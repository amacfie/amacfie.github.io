>To return to my grandmother's family ... the ... sister, Lady Charlotte
>Portal was ... apt to express herself unfortunately.
>On One occasion when she had to order a cab for three people, she thought a
>hansom would be too small and a four-wheeler too large, so she told the
>footman to fetch a three-wheeled cab.
>On another occasion, the footman, whose name was George, was seeing her off
>at the station when she was on her way to the Continent.
>Thinking that she might have to write to him about some household matter she
>suddenly remembered that she did not know his surname.
>Just after the train had started she put her head out of the window and called
>out, 'George, George, what's your name?'
>'George, My Lady', came the answer. By that time he was out of earshot.
