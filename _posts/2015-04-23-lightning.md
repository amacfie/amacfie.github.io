title: Mathematics conference reform
---

I would say that the main value of mathematics conferences is networking, and
to a lesser extent, sampling current research trends.
Attendees want to hear what others have been working on, so each person with
something to talk about might as well make a public presentation to tell
everyone at the same time.
These presentations should be merely polished, well organized versions of
what the presenter would say in an informal conversation, with plenty
of background so people can understand the context.
If I want to know what people are working on, I want to know what problems
they're working on, not what technical proofs they've come up with.
In my experience, conference talks are too long;
listeners should read the paper to get the details.
Mathematics needs
[lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk).

Then again, most people get more value out of live lectures than I do, so
my opinion may not be shared universally.
