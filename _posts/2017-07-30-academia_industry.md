title: "Academia vs. industry"
---

Here are some differences between working in academia (computer science or
mathematics) and industry (engineering or software development).

* _Size of communities_: The number of people out there working on the same
  sort of stuff that you are is way higher in industry.
* _Reinventing the wheel_: Partly because of the fact that there are so many
  people working in parallel in industry, there is a lot more duplication of
  effort and less standardization. In mathematics there can be
  multiple systems built to do the same thing, e.g. nonstandard analysis, and
  sometimes people intentionally reprove old results; but in the world of
  software, having two or more directly competing libraries is extremely
  common.
* _Freedom_: In academia you have much more latitude to choose what to work on,
  although it depends on your career stage.
  On the other hand, there is less certainty that your work will be valued
  by anyone.
* _Time horizons_: In engineering, tasks are completed, requirements change,
  and tools evolve in a relatively short timeframe.
  Compare with the years that it took Sir Andrew Wiles to prove Fermat's Last
  Theorem.
  Also, the slower rate of change in science means it's easier to keep up with
  other people's work.
* _Fame_: Academics work in public, engineers work in private. Mathematicians
  such as A. Wiles have a real chance to achieve a kind of fame: to be publicly
  known for one's work by many people and for a long time. The vast majority of
  engineers, no matter how skilled they are, can have recognition within their
  company at most.
* _Team vs. solo_: Academics collaborate, but engineers are more likely to
  work in larger teams have more frequent team interactions.
* _Money_: Academics can make good money if they become tenured professors.
  But jobs are scarce and most people at even the postdoc stage (typically
  late 20s) get very poor pay.
* _Mental energy_: Research in the formal sciences requires
  maximum mental exertion. Engineering requires thinking but the intensity
  is different.
* _Secondary activities_: Academics are loaded with non-research duties
  that may even eclipse their research altogether. The typical Engineer does
  "engineering" all day every day.
