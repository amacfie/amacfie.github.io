>Chung-ni [another name for Confucius] once called a boy of ten years of age
>his instructor; for, of old, even perfect and wise men learned diligently.
>
>Chao, when he held the office of Chung-ling, read Sun-yu. Though filling so
>high a situation, he yet learned diligently -- so much so, that he never laid
>the book out of his hand.
>
>In the time of the emperor Sung, Lu-wen-shu was constantly looking over the
>books engraven on leaves.
>
>Wu-yao made leaves of the reed bamboo, by paring it thin. Though he did not
>possess books [as we do], he exerted himself in the pursuit of knowledge.
>
>Sun-king suspended his head by its hair to the beam of his house, to prevent
>his sleeping over his books.
>
>Su-tsin pricked his thigh with an awl, to prevent his sleeping.
>
>Those persons, though not taught, of themselves rigorously pursued their
>studies.
>
>Che-yin, when a boy, being poor, read his book by the light of a glow-worm
>which he confined. And Sun-kang, in winter, read his book by the light reflected
>from snow. Though their families were poor they studied incessantly.
>
>Chu-mai-chin, though he subsisted by carrying fire-wood round the town to sell,
>yet carefully read his book. At last he became capable of, and filled a public
>office.
>
>Li-mie, while watching his cattle in the field, always had his book at hand,
>suspended to the horn of a cow. These two persons, though their bodies were
>wearied by labor yet studied hard.
>
>Su-lao-tsiuen, at the age of twenty-seven years began to exert himself, and
>read a great many books. He, when at that age, repented of his delay: you,
>a little boy, should early consider.
>
>Leang-hao, at the age of eighty-two, was permitted to answer the emperor in
>his palace, and was placed at the head of all the literati. In the evening of
>life his wishes were fulfilled, and all spoke of his extraordinary learning.
>You, a little boy, ought to determine to pursue your studies.
>
>Yung, at eight hears of age could recite the Odes. Li-pi, at seven years of age
>could play chess. These clever and studious boys were called by everyone
>wonderful. You, youths, ought to imitate them.
>
>Tsai-wen-ki could play a stringed instrument. Sie-tao-wen could sing well.
>These ladies were clever. You, who are a gentleman, ought at an early time of
>life, to perfect that which is suitable.
>
>Chin-tung, a remarkable lad, was raised by the emperor to fill the office of
>Ching-tsi. He, though a youth, was made a public officer. Do you, youths,
>exert yourselves to learn, and you may arrive at the same. Let all who make
>learning their pursuit be as those persons whom we have mentioned.
>
>It is natural for a dog to watch at night, and for a cock to crow in the
>morning; if anyone does not learn, how can he be called a man?
