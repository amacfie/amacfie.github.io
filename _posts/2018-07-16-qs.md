(These are some questions, which may well be already addressed in the
literature, I haven't checked.)

Should job candidates place [conditional
bets](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/dumpceo.html) on how productive they’d be
if hired?
<!--
Should other people who know the candidate or company be able to bet too?
redundant
-->

Should children be able to sue parents if they divorce, give birth out of
wedlock, etc?

Should someone start selling insurance against online mob victimization and
other “life/career ruining” reputation attacks?

How should a country transition to [futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html),
if it starts with a highly corrupt government?

People have a tendency, perhaps intentional, to claim that policies themselves,
rather than the policies’ apparent goals, are axiomatic good things.
Is this a vulnerability in futarchy, since then they would be voted on as
values rather than bet on as beliefs?

Why is betting psychologically safe in finance (that is, trading) but dangerous
in casinos? As binary options are prone to fraud according to Wikipedia, what
does that say about the viability of
[prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market)?

How should we apply and evaluate informal models, e.g. the broad theories of
Carl Jung and
[Stephen Wolfram](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/)?
Does abstract/vague/informal/subjective/qualitative imply unfalsifiable or is
there a way of formalizing the informal?

If the health system is
[inefficient](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/rand_health_ins.html), how
much of the problem is caused by doctors (and their guilds)? Similarly for
legal system and lawyers.

Why are "theories" helpful in science but "ideologies" unhelpful in politics?

Was Julian Simon right? What is the real relationship between population and
GDP in the short and long run?

People from Bertrand Russell to Tyler Cowen and Peter Thiel have remarked on
increasing societal risk/change aversion and the concomitant stagnation -- what
is best to reboot “dynamism”: Move to a different country? Reform the current
one? Seasteading? Form more-dynamic enclave within the country? Work in
digital/crypto realm? Is this a [farmer-forager](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/fear-made-farmers.html)
issue? Can foragers be dynamic?

If [certain mental traits](https://www.primalpoly.com/the-mating-mind) are
Zahavian signals that indicate computational resources, does this predict
asymmetry in cognitive abilities between the sex that signals and the sex that
chooses, assuming $$P \neq NP$$?

In Japan, finding a defendant not guilty is culturally frowned upon, and
the consequences of this are predictably bizarre; see
[link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRn4xzaugbk),
[link2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Just_Didn't_Do_It).
Is there a hidden rationality here?

The fact that classical utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism are
different is an example of how my preferences for you might not be the same as
your preferences for yourself.
How much of regulatory paternalism is explained by the government having
different preferences about citizens’ lives than the citizens do,
relative to [other theories](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/08/explaining-paternalism.html)?
[Robert Wiblin discussed in [2012](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/10/paternalism-can-be-kind-just-not-to-present-you.html).]

If tastes in physical beauty
[change](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/archives/when-fat-was-in-fashion-abundant-flesh-was-a-thing-of-beauty-to.html)
a lot, to what extent can they be explained by sexual selection?

Why are criminals so disliked?

In schools, why do teachers but not students get comfortable office chairs?

Why does Microsoft employ developers in Seattle when [they could get them
for half price](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ssl0l/why_are_there_such_big_salary_discrepancies/dt79wry/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
in Vancouver?
