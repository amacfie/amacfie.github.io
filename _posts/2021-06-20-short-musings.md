When I was 17 my lowest grade was in math and I thought I wasn't good at it.
One year later I was obsessed with it. Things can change.

Robin Hanson says that academia views impractical research as more prestigious.
Yes, pure mathematics and theoretical physics are impractical and prestigious
but ceteris paribus a research finding plus an application is more prestigious
than just a research finding.

There's a meta-contrarian idea that the mechanisms of academia exclude some
really good science that's just too unconventional. This is not true to the
extent claimed.
<!-- Tyler Cowen said something like this somewhere. -->

Computer algebra is useful but discovering new algorithms to automate
mathematical work is hard.

As Robin Hanson and Steve Levitt say, life is long. There's lots of time to
do lots of different things.

Re: [Where are All the Successful Rationalists?](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/),
rationality is an important scientific concept in AI, finance, and statistics;
its value as a self-help technique is not so clear.

Beauty is subjective and calling your product "beautiful" is pretentious.

Juergen Schmidhuber is right and Tyler Cowen is wrong: China will surpass
the US in dominance this century.

Geoffrey Miller and Robin Hanson have different views on what people are
signaling when they engage in politics: Miller says personal traits and
Hanson says tribal loyalty. Presumably it's some of each but I find Miller
more convincing.

Robin Hanson says meditation is about signaling who's a better meditator.
This is an example of meta-contrarianism at one too many levels of meta.

Robin Hanson is the most interesting blogger there is.

The rapid decision-making abilities of basketball and soccer players impress me
as much as the physical.
