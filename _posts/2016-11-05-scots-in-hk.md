It should be noted that not only were Jardine and Matheson Hong Kong's "first
[Tai-Pans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai-pan)", running the
largest British trading firm in East Asia,
but they were [principally
responsible][travel] for architecting the Opium Wars and the Treaty of Nanjing
which formally acquired Hong Kong.
Starting from a tiny fishing village,
Hong Kong grew as a British colony to have [over a quarter][gdp] of
the GDP of China, with 0.5% of its population (and 12% of the GDP of the UK).

Dr. Jardine as painted in the 1820s:
