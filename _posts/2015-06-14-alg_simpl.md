title: Neural networks for algebraic simplification
---

In a [paper from 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1584), Zaremba, Kurach, and
Fergus attack a case of the algebraic simplification problem with recursive
neural networks.
General algebraic simplification is of course a search problem with Turing
degree $$\mathbf{0}'$$ so it is natural to try AI methods given what we know
about AIXI.
It might be enlightening to see whether machine learning methods can do as
well as traditional, domain specific algorithms in computer algebra.
The paper uses an interesting definition of expression complexity:
the computational running time associated with naive numerical evaluation of
the expression.
This algorithmic view of algebraic expressions is a good step in modeling
what people generally desire in an expression, as discussed by
[Wilf](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2321713?seq=1).
