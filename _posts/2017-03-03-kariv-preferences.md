title: Shachar Kariv on economic aspects of moral preferences and rationality
---

1\. [Who is (More) Rational?](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~kariv/CKMS_I.pdf)
(2014).
If people reveal preferences which are e.g. intransitive, they are deemed
irrational and there are ways of quantifying this.
This paper finds a positive relationship between quantified rationality
and wealth:

>Revealed preference theory offers a criterion for decision-making quality: if
>decisions are high quality then there exists a utility function the choices
>maximize. We conduct a large-scale experiment to test for consistency with
>utility maximization. Consistency scores vary markedly within and across
>socioeconomic groups. In particular, consistency is strongly related to wealth:
>a standard deviation increase in consistency is associated with 15-19 percent
>more household wealth. This association is quantitatively robust to
>conditioning on correlates of unobserved constraints, preferences, and beliefs.
>Consistency with utility maximization under laboratory conditions thus captures
>decision-making ability that applies across domains and influences important
>real-world outcomes.

2\.
[Distributional Preferences and Political Behavior](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~kariv/FJK_II.pdf)
(2016).
Two key properties of an (income) distribution are mean and variance, and when
they cannot simultaneously be maximized and minimized, respectively, there is
an equality-efficiency tradeoff.
Kariv quantifies individual preferences for equality vs. efficiency in
groups and finds these preferences predict political views:

>We decompose distributional preferences into fair-mindedness (weight
>on oneself vs. others) and equality-efficiency tradeoffs, and measure both at
>the individual level in a large and diverse sample of Americans. We find
>considerable heterogeneity in both the extent of fairmindedness and willingness
>to trade off equality and efficiency, much of which cannot be explained by
>standard socioeconomic or demographic variables. Subjects' equality- efficiency
>tradeoffs predict their political decisions: equality-focused subjects are more
>likely to have voted for Barack Obama, and to be affiliated with the Democratic
>Party. Our findings shed light on how American voters are motivated by their
>distributional preferences.
