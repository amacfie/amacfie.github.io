title: Plausibility and probability in deductive reasoning
---

How would you bet on the proposition "the $$10^{100!}$$th decimal
digit of $$\pi$$ is $$7$$"?
Would you accept odds of about $$1$$ to $$9$$?
The proposition is totally deterministic, and in fact if you had a sufficiently
powerful computer you could find the actual value without gathering any new
information from the outside world.

I'm far from the first person to think about such questions, but I did make
a personal attempt to generally understand how probabilities could/should
work with deductive statements.
However, making progress has been very time consuming.
Because of that, and other reasons, I no longer have time for this project for
the foreseeable future.
So, I'm publicly releasing a very unfinished draft of my work.
It is available here:
<https://www.overleaf.com/docs/dwgpkqxygnyp/pdf.pdf>.
If the PDF link does not work it can be viewed here:

I would like to thank Z. Gao and C. Yanofsky for useful pointers, and
B. Barak and V. Kosoy for crucial extended discussions.
