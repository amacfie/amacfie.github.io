title: Art attack
---

I used to think that "abstract art" meant "doodles" or "pictures of unrealistic
stuff".
It wasn't until recently that I realized that "abstract" in "abstract art"
has the same meaning as in software and formal science:
working with a whole set of objects satisfying certain properties
in order to focus on the properties, not the entire individual objects.
This painting, called Caribbean Dreaming by
[Tracy Armstrong](http://www.artbytracyarmstrong.com/gallery2/),
for me represents a set of scenes with the properties of blue and white at the
top, soft green around most of the bottom, and some strong blue in some areas
of the bottom.

Indeed, there's a strong suggestion of a peaceful view of a small body of water
and some greenery beneath a warm blue sky.
I've seen enough of these scenes to recognize it and fill in the rest of the
details myself.
The particular details of any one such scene don't matter greatly.

<br />

My favorite abstract artist has long been
[Jesar](http://jesar.deviantart.com/gallery/).
His Quarter Past Midnight Series, which includes the image below,
uses extraordinary colors and shapes to express the simplicity and material
minimalism sometimes found in electronic industrial design and systems of
elegantly interacting parts.

Being an abstract image, the design of the object is allowed to be completely
artifical, symbolizing the conquering of natural constraints to create
perfection.

3D fractals are a new art form that can display great apparent complexity
but are produced by simple algorithms.
The works of [Tom Beddard](http://sub.blue/), including "Aurullia", below,
are another example of capturing the essence of a scene, in this case an
urbanscape, without specific details.

I love urbanscapes; to me they represent human progress, but the number of
cars on the roads doesn't matter, the exact distribution of building heights
doesn't matter, neither does the angle of the shadows, etc.
Hence the magic of this work.
Simple images can also invoke a sense of being
["futuristic"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/the-future-seems-shiny.html),
which amplifies the appeal.

<br />

These ideas certainly bring Schmidhuber's theory of beauty to mind.
His ["Femme Fractale"](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/femmefractale.html)
was explicitly intended to have high "apparent" compexity but low Kolmogorov
complexity:

This post has an air of "reducing art to a formula", but I think these insights
actually increase my appreciation for these art forms.
It's almost as if the formal models themselves are on display, which
makes art seem very compatible with the aesthetic semsibilities of a formal
scientist and worthy and appropriate to be associated with.
