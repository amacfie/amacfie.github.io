In this post I'll share a way to get a Grooveshark-like experience with
a Linux command-line application.

Step 1: Build a YouTube playlist with some music you like.

Step 2: Go to your channel, select _Playlists_, find the one you just made,
and click _View full playlist_.
Make sure the privacy setting is either public or unlisted.
Copy the playlist ID in the URL (after `list=`).
For example, the playlist ID of one of my playlists is
`PLmaRvdyzIrIGkRbl7jJdzEYrRcXe4od9G`.

Step 3: Install `mpv` and [`mps-youtube`](`https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube`).

Step 4: Run

    mpsyt pl <playlist ID>, \*

You're streaming the playlist!
Press `<space>` to pause/play, `<` to play previous track, `>` to play next
track.


To play the playlist shuffed, run this instead:

    mpsyt pl <playlist ID>, shuffle \*

I have this alias in my `.zshrc` file:

    alias playlistName="mpsyt pl PLmaRvdyzIrIGkRbl7jJdzEYrRcXe4od9G, shuffle \*"

so I can get music playing with just one command.

If, as in Grooveshark, your YouTube playlists are public, you can open
`mpsyt` and run `userpl <YouTube username>` to see your YouTube playlists
and select one to play.

The good thing is that the whole videos aren't streamed, just high-quality
audio.

Among other features, `mpsyt` allows you to search for YouTube videos and
create local playlists (not connected to a YouTube account), which you can do
if you want to avoid the YouTube web interface completely.
