[Tall buildings by city: look out for Toronto.](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com)
The current top cities in North America for sky scrapers are unambiguously
New York, [Chicago](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/compare-data/submit?type%5B%5D=building&status%5B%5D=COM&status%5B%5D=UC&status%5B%5D=UCT&status%5B%5D=STO&status%5B%5D=PRO&base_city=1539&base_height_range=0&base_company=All&base_min_year=1900&base_max_year=9999&skip_comparison=on&output%5B%5D=list),
and [Toronto](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/compare-data/submit?type%5B%5D=building&status%5B%5D=COM&status%5B%5D=UC&status%5B%5D=UCT&status%5B%5D=STO&status%5B%5D=PRO&base_city=723&base_height_range=0&base_company=All&base_min_year=1900&base_max_year=9999&skip_comparison=on&output%5B%5D=list)
in that order.
However, if we count proposed buildings and buildings under construction,
Chicago has _18_ at least 150m tall (the dataset is only complete for buildings
at least 150m) and Toronto has _90_.
