title: The next piece of the anonymity toolbox
---

Tor provides anonymity for network traffic.
If I connect to a server through Tor, the traffic gets sent through a path of
intermediary Tor relays.
If a third party wants to see which server I'm talking to, it will need to gain
access to the logs of all the intermediary relays.
For sufficiently long intermediate paths, this is practically impossible.

If you want to perform a public action online, but stay anonymous, Tor does the
trick.
However, if you want to perform a monetary transaction online and stay
anonymous, you need a different tool.
Bitcoin itself certainly isn't that tool since bitcoin transaction logs are
public, but methods have been discussed to turn it into one.
One option is [distributed mixers](http://www.coindesk.com/taxonomy-bitcoin-mixing-services-policymakers/)
which (roughly) apply the tor idea to bitcoin transactions:
An observer will see a set addresses send BTC and a set receive BTC but won't
be able to tell which sent to which.
Another option is an altcoin with anonymity built in, to and from which BTC can
be converted freely, breaking up BTC transaction histories.
Such an altcoin is Moneta (and [possibly](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/anoncoin-price-crashes-developer-announces-zerocoin-delay/) 
[anoncoin](https://anoncoin.net/)),
which will implement the
[ZeroCoin protocol](https://moneta.cash/technology.html#b).

Both options have the potential to provide strong financial anonymity, i.e.
money laundering, but what all current options lack is the maturity of Tor
which has stood the test of time under analysis of the security community.
At least one [serious bug](http://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-sharedcoin-users-can-identified-says-security-expert/)
was found (and fixed) in the web-wallet-integrated peer mixer SharedCoin, which
already provides weak anonymity for single transactions (["inherently the
anonymity set is probably only going
to be two people"](http://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-sharedcoin-users-can-identified-says-security-expert/#comment-1428027743)).
Still, over time there is no doubt that a trusted solution will emerge.
