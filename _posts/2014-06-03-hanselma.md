[Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) 
is a website with videos about Microsoft technologies for developers.
Here's one of my favorite (old) "This Week on Channel 9" episodes:

Channel 9 has some very funny presenters, such as Paul Mestemaker, Scott
Hanselman, and Dan Fernandez (at least two of those three have stand-up
experience).
