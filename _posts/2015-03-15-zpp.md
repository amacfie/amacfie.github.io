How exactly to use Solomonoff induction in an artificial general intelligence
(AGI) is
[not yet clear](http://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_76.pdf),
but it is clear that a Solomonoff induction oracle would be very useful to
any AGI.
Besides, if we can come up with a good enough automated theorem prover, we
can asynchronously come up with any high-level AGI model we want, and let the
prover find the fastest way to perform the necessary computations.
Thus, we can start working on Solomonoff induction and/or theorem proving
algorithms now and employ them whenever someone has an abstract formal model
for AGI they want to implement, such as AIXI or a modification thereof.

Now, assuming Solomonoff induction has Turing degree $$\mathbf{0'}$$,
theorem proving and Solomonoff induction are equivalent (in a fairly hazy
sense, for now).
So [formal scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science)
looking for work applicable to AGI, or absolutely anything else, have a simple
problem to solve: Find a good approximate algorithm for either problem, or
any other problem with the same Turing degree.
Hence the significance of the
[zero prime program](http://amacfie.github.io/ZeroPrime/genprobs.html).

Like (ex)-LessWrongers in general, I'm drawn to big ideas.
I've been thinking about the zero prime program because, like Juergen
Schmidhuber, I wanted to solve the most general problem possible, in formal
science and, only originally, in physical science.
Automated theorem proving is presumably the most general problem in formal
science, and for the reasons stated above, it's closely related to the
formalization of inductive inference, and the zero prime program covers it all.
[Beauty](http://localhost:4000/2014/05/27/beaut/) was another consideration.
I prefer formal science to modeling -- after all, problems in formal logic
can be either solved or not, while modeling invariably leads to meta-modeling --
so I'm quite satisfied to have an open-ended
formal problem that is necessary for AGI, although not sufficient
(and I certainly don't need to be involved in modeling AGI
[utility functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism)).
Unfortunately, for the short- to medium-term future, I'll be putting my
contributions to this project on hold, since I can only work in one area
full-time, and for now it's something else.
