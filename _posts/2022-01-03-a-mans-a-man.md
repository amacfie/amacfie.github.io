---

On the occasion of [Nima Hoda](https://www.math.ens.psl.eu/~hoda/)'s wedding.

[Original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man%27s_A_Man_for_A%27_That):

>Is there for honest Poverty <br />
>That hings his head, an' a' that; <br />
>The coward slave - we pass him by, <br />
>We dare be poor for a' that! <br />
>For a' that, an' a' that. <br />
>Our toils obscure an' a' that, <br />
>The rank is but the guinea's stamp, <br />
>The Man's the gowd for a' that.
>
>What though on hamely fare we dine, <br />
>Wear hodden grey, an' a that; <br />
>Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine; <br />
>A Man's a Man for a' that: <br />
>For a' that, and a' that, <br />
>Their tinsel show, an' a' that; <br />
>The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, <br />
>Is king o' men for a' that.
>
>Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord, <br />
>Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that; <br />
>Tho' hundreds worship at his word, <br />
>He's but a coof for a' that: <br />
>For a' that, an' a' that, <br />
>His ribband, star, an' a' that: <br />
>The man o' independent mind <br />
>He looks an' laughs at a' that.
>
>A prince can mak a belted knight, <br />
>A marquis, duke, an' a' that; <br />
>But an honest man's abon his might, <br />
>Gude faith, he maunna fa' that! <br />
>For a' that, an' a' that, <br />
>Their dignities an' a' that; <br />
>The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth, <br />
>Are higher rank than a' that.
>
>Then let us pray that come it may, <br />
>(As come it will for a' that,) <br />
>That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, <br />
>Shall bear the gree, an' a' that. <br />
>For a' that, an' a' that, <br />
>It's coming yet for a' that, <br />
>That Man to Man, the world o'er, <br />
>Shall brothers be for a' that.


Modern English:

>Should honest poor hang their heads? <br />
>We pass by the coward who is ashamed of his poverty <br />
>We dare be poor despite all that! <br />
>Despite all that, and all that, <br />
>Our humble work, and all that, <br />
>Aristocratic rank is but the form that gold is cast into, <br />
>The man himself is the gold.
>
>So what if we dine on homely fare, <br />
>Wear rough grey tweed, and all that? <br />
>Give fools their silks, and knaves their wine - <br />
>A man is a man despite all that. <br />
>Despite all that, and all that, <br />
>Their ostentation, and all that, <br />
>The honest man, though ever so poor, <br />
>Is king of men despite all that.
>
>You see that person called a "lord", <br />
>Who struts, and postures, and all that? <br />
>Though hundreds worship at his word, <br />
>He is but a fool for all that. <br />
>Despite all that, and all that, <br />
>His regalia, and all that, <br />
>The man of independent mind, <br />
>He looks and laughs at all that.
>
>A prince can bestow the title of knight, <br />
>Or marquis, duke, and all that! <br />
>But an honest man is above all of these - <br />
>Good faith, he must not fault that <br />
>Despite all that, and all that, <br />
>Their titles, and all that, <br />
>Strength of sense and pride of merit <br />
>Are higher rank than all that.
>
>Then let us pray that it may come <br />
>(As come it will despite all that) <br />
>That sense and merit over all the earth <br />
>Will prevail and all that! <br />
>Despite all that, and all that, <br />
>It is coming yet despite all that, <br />
>That man to man the world over <br />
>Will be brothers despite all that.
