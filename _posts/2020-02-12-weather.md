title: "Ranking cities by weather"
---

Let's analyze data from <https://darksky.net> from the last 10 years to compare
weather (technically "climate") in a selection of North American cities.

If we define a "nice day" as one where
* there are at least 10 hours of daylight,
* the high apparent temperature is at least 0°C and at most 30°C,
* the cloud cover is at most 70%, and
* the UV index is at most moderate,

we get:

City                | Probability of nice day
|-
San Diego |0.27
Los Angeles |0.23
San Francisco |0.22
Raleigh |0.22
Austin |0.2
Vancouver |0.19
New York |0.19
Cambridge |0.19
Chicago |0.16
Ottawa |0.16
Toronto |0.15
