Programming wisdom:

>Someone wrote to me once suggesting that JSLint should give a warning when a 
>[case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)
>falls through into another case.
>He pointed out that this is a very common source of errors, and it is a 
>difficult error to see in the code.
>I answered that that was all true, but that the benefit of compactness
>obtained by falling through more than compensating for the chance of error.
>The next day, he reported that there was an error in JSLint.
>...
>I investigated, and it turned out that I had a case that was falling through.
>...
>I no longer use intentional fall throughs.
